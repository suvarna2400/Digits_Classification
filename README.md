### Digits_Classification

Various algorithms were trained with all various parameters in which the best classifier along with their accuracy was generated as output and is shown below.

From the above result we can infer that the SVM gives the best result with approx of 95% accuracy and hence we can also infer that it is best suited algo for digits classification.
